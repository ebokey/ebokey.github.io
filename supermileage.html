                    <p>
                        The UBC Supermileage Team is a student-led team that designs and builds three super-efficient vehicles that compete in international competitions:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A Prototype class vehicle with a gasoline internal combustion engine</li>
                            <li>A battery-electric Urban Concept class vehicle</li>
                            <li>A hydrogen fuel-cell Prototype vehicle</li>
                        </ul>

                        Through this work the team raises awareness for sustainable transportation, and also provides students with invaluable learning experiences.

                                            While not quite the same as competition, it was a great opportunity for members who hadn't been to competition before to get some exposure to a similar environment.
                                            There was a lot of pressure to get the new fuel cell vehicle running, but everyone performed exceptionally and we finally got to see all our hard work validated when the vehicle successfully ran.
