                                                        I used ANSYS Composite PrepPost to simulate the deflection and safety factor of various composite structures, and selected the best option based on safety factor and mass.
                                                        Myself and another team member then used wet layup methods to manufacture the composite sandwich, then cut out the final chassis shape.

                                                        Aerodynamic principles and SOLIDWORKS were used to generate various concepts that aimed to reduce the overall drag.
                                                        Shell models were then imported into Star-CCM+, and the aerodynamic performance of each was simulated.

                                                        This redesign was required due to competition rule changes.
                                                        My team and I used composite analysis to look at various mounting solutions, and performed prototype testing to find a foot-actuation system design.
                                                        Various concepts were modelled using SOLIDWORKS.

                                                        As part of a senior year course, myself and a partner were tasked with developing an integrated mechatronics system.
                                                        We built an automated system that sorts building blocks based on colour. 
                                                        This project involved a lot of mechanical design, 3D-printing, electrical circuitry, and firmware coding.

                        <h6>Objective</h6>
                        <p>
                            With the development of a brand new fuel cell Prototype vehicle in 2020-2021 came the need for a new chassis.
                            The goal was to make this new chassis more light-weight than the current chassis for the team's gasoline Prototype vehicle, which was built in early 2018.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was responsible for leading this project, and ensuring that the chassis was built by the summer of 2021.
                            In order to improve our design capabilities, I introduced the team to ANSYS Composite PrepPost (ACP) for simulating the strength and stiffness of composite chassis designs.
                            I then carried out a number of simulations, and eventually organized and led the manufacturing with the help of a few team members.
                        </p>

                        <h6>Chassis Design</h6>
                        <p>
                            The shape of the chassis was constrained because it needed to work with an already-existing aerodynamic shell.
                            Therefore, the major design decisions involved the materials and construction of the chassis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A composite sandwich structure was selected, as the team had previous experience with this construction and were very successful utilizing it - the 2018 gasoline Prototype chassis used this very structure.
                            The sandwich faces would be made using carbon fibre composite, due to this engineering material's high stiffness-to-mass ratio.
                            The core of the sandwich would be a Nomex honeycomb, which both increases the 2nd moment of area and the shear strength of the chassis with relatively low mass.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ACP simulations were carried out to test different sandwich constructions.
                            Some different aspects of the construction explored included the number of carbon fibre layers, orientation of these layers, and the use of stiffening plies.
                            In total 55 simulations were completed, and a final design with a safety factor of 4 was selected.
                        </p>

                        <h6>Manufacturing</h6>
                        <p>
                            With the chassis designed, the next step was to build it. The team had the goal of building the new fuel cell vehicle by the summer of 2021, so that meant this chassis needed to be built with ongoing restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
                            The restrictions, which included limited us to two team members working in our space at a time, meant that the entire manufacturing process for the chassis had to be developed from the ground-up with these restrictions in mind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The manufacturing process was done in four parts:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Lay up one face of the chassis</li>
                                <li>Lay up the other face of the chassis</li>
                                <li>Sandwich the faces and the Nomex core</li>
                                <li>Cut out the final chassis shape</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We successfully built the chassis in time to run the new fuel cell vehicle in July of 2021.
                            The chassis design used was 28% lighter than the 2018 gasoline Prototype chassis.

                            The current aerodynamic shell for the team's Urban Concept vehicle was manufactured in 2016, and as a result is showing signs of its age.
                            There are multiple fit issues with the door and back hatch, leading to unwanted aerodynamic losses. This shell also has some design flaws, including a blunt tail (creating flow separation) and no underbody design.
                            With all these issues in mind, the team started thinking about designing a new shell for the vehicle in the summer of 2020.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            I was initially one of three Vehicle Mechanics Division Leads overseeing this project in the summer of 2020.
                            Due to various factors however, I ended up spearheading much of the work for this project over the course of the 2020-2021 academic year. My first task was to learn how to use Star-CCM+, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software.
                            After learning how to use the software, I began comparing the performance of the current 2016 shell to one I designed using SOLIDWORKS (titled "Concept E").
                        </p>

                        <h6>Design and Testing</h6>
                        <p>
                            An initial round of shell concepts were developed with the help of various team members.
                            The goal of this concept generation phase was to develop a wide variety of concepts that would be compatible with the current internal structure of the car, so that there was no need to redesign the entire vehicle.
                            Since the UBC Supermileage Team's ultimate goal is to create super-efficient vehicles, all concepts were designed with the aim of reducing aerodynamic drag.
                        </p>

                        <figure class="text-center">

                        </figure>

                        <p>
                            Several of these concepts were then modelled in SOLIDWORKS, in order to create a CAD model for CFD simulations and also to make sure vehicle internals fit inside the design.
                            CAD models were then exported to Parasolid format, with the wheels included, and imported into Star-CCM+.
                            By creating a virtual wind tunnel and setting up parameters, various aerodynamic properties such as drag and downforce were estimated.

                            During the work done in 2020-2021, simulation time was spent comparing the 2016 shell with the Concept E mentioned previously.
                            Initial simulation predicted that the Concept E had 25% less aerodynamic drag (2.95 Newtons) compared to the 2016 design (3.93 Newtons), demonstrating the room for improvement.
                            There were also multiple improvements identified with Concept E that, if implemented, could lead to even greater gains in efficiency.

                        <p>
                            Due to the emphasis on the team's new fuel cell Prototype vehicle in the first half of 2021, I was unable to see the design process to completion before moving from the position of Vehicle Mechanics Division Lead to Team Captain.
                            However, my work was not in vain as it showed the potential improvements the team can make to the Urban Concept vehicle's aerodynamics.
                            My experience also allowed me to introduce other members of the team to the project and train them, with hopes of completing the new shell in the summer of 2022.

                        <h6>Objective</h6>
                        <p>
                            Before the 2019-2020 year, the team's gasoline Prototype vehicle used mechanical bike disc brakes on each wheel.
                            All the brakes were engaged by hand using two standard brake levers. However, for our 2020 Shell Eco-marathons competition the rules were changed so that:
                            <ul>
                                <li>All brakes must be hydraulic</li>
                                <li>The front brakes must be foot-actuated</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I led the project group tasked with designing a new braking system that complied with the rules.
                            My main responsibilities were managing our groups timelines to ensure the project's completion, onboarding my group members to various design tools and techniques, and supporting their work.
                            I also did a lot of design work for this project, including selecting and procuring new hydraulic brakes and designing the foot-actuation system.
                        </p>

                        <h6>Design</h6>
                        <p>
                            The foot-actuation system was a challenging design problem.
                            Firstly, a foot pedal system needed to be designed that was strong enough and also worked with off-the-shelf bike brakes.
                            We eventually decided to create a pedal that worked with the existing brake lever for the hydraulic system, to avoid any issues with splicing together our own master cylinder system.
                            Various concepts were generated by members of the project group.
                            Along with finding a concept that was strong and worked with existing components, we also needed to ensure the foot pedal was useable by the driver and also didn't obstruct their vision while in the vehicle (a unique problem for the Prototype vehicles since the driver lays down).
                        </p>

                        <figure class="text-center">
                            <img src="./img/projects/pro-brakes/Brake-Concepts.png" alt="" class="img-fluid p-2" width="40%" />
                            <figcaption><small>Various concepts I drew for the foot-actuation system</small></figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>
                            The location and mounting of the foot pedal needed to be determined as well.
                            There were two primary options considered: mounting to the vehicle chassis or the aerodynamic shell. Because the driver's legs extend off the chassis and sit on the shell, mounting to the chassis would involve extending a support structure along the driver's legs.
                            Through composite simulation, I determined that extending this support structure would be add much more weight than stiffening the shell with carbon fibre so that it could withstand the force on the pedal.
                        </p>

                        <h6>Prototyping</h6>
                        <p>
                            With the location of the pedal determined, various prototypes were developed.
                            Some included a crude sheet-metal pedal, used to find what pedal angles were comfortable with the driver.
                            Another was a PLA mount and pedal (pictured below) to test out some different methods of fastening the brake levers to the mount.
                            This prototype was also used to see if 3D-printed PLA could be strong enough for this application.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Using feedback from these prototypes, I designing the final brake lever mount and foot pedal.
                            The mount was designed to hold two brake levers (one for the front brakes, and one for the rear) using a clamping lid, and bolt directly to the vehicle shell using studs.
                            The pedal slipped over the brake levers, and could be fastened using a zip tie. The design was then 3D-printed using PLA, and installed on the vehicle for testing.
                        </p>

                        <h6>Outcomes</h6>
                        <p>
                            After installing the final version of the brake system, the team held a track day to test out the vehicle.
                            During testing we found the new hydraulic system to be super effect at stopping the vehicle; if anything it was too good, as we put a bald spot in a tire by stopping too fast.
                            The mounts and shell were found to be more than strong enough, and the driver found that visibility was still sufficient with the pedal present.
                            Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 we never got the chance to test the new braking system at competition.

                        <hr />

                        <p>
                            Instead of working on a standing Mechanical Engineering capstone project, I decided to complete my engineering capstone through the New Venture Design (NVD) program at UBC.
                            NVD puts a focus on teaching students entrepreneurship, and having them work in inter-disciplinary teams; all NVD teams are comprised of 3 technical students and 3 business students.
                            NVD students are tasked with developing their own venture, from nothing to a full business plan and Minimum Viable Prototype (MVP).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My group and I eventually settled on the venture SOLO, designed to enchance environmental awareness for hard-of-hearing individuals.
                            The device the venture was built around is a wearable microphone array that performs sound recognition localization.
                            A haptic wristband then indicates the direction that keys sounds are coming from to the user.
                            Our primary target customers were hard-of-hearing individuals who have difficulties picking out important sounds in their environment, and/or 
                            having troubles determining what direction sounds are coming from.

                        <p>
                            NVD runs throughout the entire school year, with the first term focused on problem development and selection.
                            In other words, the first half of the course is spent picking potential ventures, validating which ventures are viable, and picking one to move forward with.
                            The second term is then spent creating a full business plan and making the MVP.
                            The MVP in particular is a prototype that communicates the feasibility and basic functionality.
                            The SOLO MVP was created with a Raspberry Pi to prototype the microphone array, and an Arduino Nano to prototype the haptic wristband.
                            We then were able to demonstrate our working MVP at the final NVD presentation night.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To make a prototype of the microphone array, we procured a Raspberry Pi and a 4-mic array that connected directly ontop of the Pi.
                            The Pi was loaded with a Python script that runs audio processing software that detected a keyword in the environment, and then calculated the Direction of Arrival (DOA).
                            The 'quadrant' that the sound's source belongs to (front, right, back, or left) is then determined and sent to the wristband through serial communication.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The wristband prototype was created using an Arduino Nano as the controller, and 4 vibrating motors to provide the user haptic feedback.
                            The serial message with the quadrant of the sound source, which was discussed in the last paragraph, is received from the Pi by the Nano.
                            This serial message is then used by the Nano to activate the vibrating motor that corresponds to that quadrant.
                            All of these components were sewn into an athletic wristband, with the motors places at 90 degree increments around the wristband.
                            Following this motor placement made the haptic feedback easier to interpret as the user can assosicate each motor with the direction it points in.
                        </p>

                            I am, admittedly, not giving this project the justice it deserves with this overview. 
                            I've provided a very high-level summary of the work we put into the MVP, and there is plenty of more work we did that I could talk about.
                            That includes testing at various stages of the design process, and a lot of research we conducted into our plan for the final SOLO device.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This overview also doesn't cover all of the work we put into developing this venture.
                            That work included getting customer input through interviews and surveys, identifying various problems, and generating concepts for solutions.
                            We also created various deliverables for the course, including a final business report, a final technical report, and a final slide deck.
                            Our business team also put incredible work into creating a full business plan behind the SOLO device.
                            I am happy to go more in-depth on this project with anyone who is interested.

                        <h6>Overview</h6>
                        <p>
                            As part of MECH 423 (Mechatronic Product Design), my partner and I were tasked with creating a mechatronics system that had real-world applications.
                            We decided to create a Lego Brick Sorter, which could automatically sort building bricks by colour.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For this project, my partner and I developed five functional requirements for the system:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Machine vision</li>
                                <li>A conveyor system</li>
                                <li>Mechanical block sorters</li>
                                <li>A user interface</li>
                                <li>Firmware</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My primary responsibilities in this project were the mechanical block sorters and the firmware used on the microcontroller.
                            I also assisted with the other portions of the project, including the conveyor system.
                        </p>

                        <h6>Conveyor</h6>
                        <p>
                            The backbone of the system is the conveyor, which moves the blocks through the sorting process.
                            The conveyor is implemented using a gaffer tape belt that spans between an active pulley driven by stepper motors and an idler pulley.
                            Motor mounts, support pieces, and belt drums were modelled in SOLIDWORKS and 3D-printed using PETG.
                            Aluminum extrusion is used for the base to allow the conveyor length to be adjusted.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Two NEMA-17 stepper motors drive one of the conveyor drums.
                            These motors are driven using two external motor driver boards, both of which are controlled by a MSP430FR5739 microcontroller board.

                        <h6>Machine Vision</h6>
                        <p>
                            A 1080p webcam, capable of 30 frames per second, is located above the start of the conveyor.
                            This webcam is connected to a personal computer, which runs machine vision software written in C# using the Accord.NET framework.
                            The software carries out a series of operations on frames from the webcam that are used to determine the colour of any block that passed through the field of vision.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A colour image from the camera are converted to greyscale and filtered using a Gaussian blur. This greyscale image is used to determine the colour.
                            The background is then removed using a threshold filter, creating a binary image that is used to find the center of any block in the field of view.
                        </p>

                        <figure class="text-center">
                            <img src="./img/projects/mech-423/VisionFlowchart.png" alt="" class="img-fluid p-2" width="20%" />
                            <figcaption><small>Flowchart of the image processing procedure</small></figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <figure class="text-center">
                            <img src="./img/projects/mech-423/ColourGrayscaleBinary.png" alt="" class="img-fluid p-2" width="40%" />

                        </figure>

                        <p>
                            When the colour is determined, a serial package is sent to the MSP430FR5739 board that contains a command byte.
                            This command byte tells the firmware on the microcontroller which block colour just passed under the camera.
                        </p>

                        <h6>Block Sorters</h6>
                        <p>
                            Multiple mechanical 'block sorters' are stationed along the length of the conveyor, which are used to push blocks off the conveyor and in to sorting bins.
                            These sorters consist of a raised platform with a pusher arm. This pusher arm is linearly actuated using a servo motor and a rack-and-pinion.
                        </p>

                        <figure class="text-center">

                        <p>
                            The servo motor of each block sorter is powered with an external 5 V supply, and controlled using PWM signals from the MSP430FR5739 board.

                        </figure>

                        <h6>Firmware and Hardware</h6>
                        <p>
                            The system firmware, which runs on the MSP430FR5739 board, controls the stepper motors of the conveyor belt and the servo motors of the block sorters.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To control the stepper motors, a timer is used to cause an interrupt every 1.54 milliseconds.
                            At each interrupt the output pins to the stepper motors are changed in order to step the motors forward.
                            This interrupt frequency gives a desired conveyor speed of 8.86 centimeters per second.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The block sorter control is a more complicated implementation, as the firmware needs to extend and retract multiple sorters, in parallel, in such a sequence where the correct blocks are pushed off and no others are impeded.
                            Circular buffers are used to track commands for each sorter as they are received via serial packages from the machine vision software.
                            When a new command is received, the firmware uses various parameters to calculate a time delay between when the block passes under the camera and when it passes in front of the correct sorter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A timer is set to cause an interrupt every 20 milliseconds, during which a counter is incremented.
                            The time delays calculated for each command are converted into a counter number, so that during each interrupt the current counter number is compared to the first element in each circular buffer.
                            If the current count equals a buffer value, then the corresponding sorter is extended or retracted (depending on the current state).
                        </p>

                            The electrical circuits for the stepper motors and servo motors were implemented using custom prototyping boards.
                            Doing so kept the wiring clean, increased reliability, and also reduced the risk of erroneous connections.

                        <h6>User Interface</h6>
                        <p>
                            The computer software used to run the machine vision also features a user interface, created using C# with the Windows Forms environment.
                            This UI lets the user connect the camera and microcontroller, monitor the camera feed, tune machine vision parameters, and also track the number of blocks sorter.

                        <p>
                            After a lot of testing, the system was successfully implemented and demonstrated to the teaching team, fellow students, and alumni. Course deliverables, including a final report and a video submission, were also completed.

                        <p>
                            On reflection, there is certainly room for improvement. The block sorters met expectations and needs, but there are more efficient methods of linearly pushing blocks off of the conveyor.
                            The machine vision was accurate after tuning, but the robustness could be greatly improved through different pixel averaging methods.
                            Having a light source mounted above the conveyor would also help.
                        </p>

                            Not a lot of detail is required here, since if you are reading this project description then you are already visiting my online portfolio.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This portfolio was built as a convenient way to list my education and experience, and also serve as a all-in-one project portfolio. 
                            It has also served as an excuse for me to get more familiar with front-end programming.

                        <p>
                            The website uses a Bootswatch theme called <a href="https://bootswatch.com/zephyr/">'Zephyr'</a>, which is designed for Bootstrap.
                            All the HTML was coded from scratch.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The portfolio is still what I would consider a 'work in progress', mainly in terms of content. 
                            There are several projects from my senior year and previous school years that I would like to add, including current ones for courses such as APSC 496 (New Venture Design) and MECH 464 (Industrial Robotics).
                            Some improvements can likely be made on the mobile side of this as well, since the initial version of the portfolio was made with computer users in mind.
